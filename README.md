## Why?

To improve user experience in various scenarios:

- When you're moving away from your PC and want to continue watching the video on your mobile device without manually searching for it.
- When you want to share a video on WhatsApp but prefer not to have WhatsApp open on your PC, allowing you to quickly share the video from your mobile device instead.

## Features

1. Opens the YouTube video in the mobile app by scanning the QR code.
2. Updates the QR code to reflect the current timestamp if the "Start At" checkbox is selected, enabling the video to continue from the exact point you were watching on your PC.

Feel free to let me know if you need any further adjustments!
