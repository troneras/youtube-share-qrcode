## Why?
For having a better UX in some cases:
- When I'm moving from my PC I may want to keep watching the video while I'm doint po** or whatever, I've to manually search the video. 
- When I want to share a video on whatsapp, I don't like to have whatsapp open in my PC, so I've to search the video in mobile and share it.

1. Opens youtube video in the mobile app
2. If you check the Start At, the QR code updates and will open the video on moobile at the exact progress you are on the PC.
