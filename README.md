## Why?
For having a better UX in some cases:
- When I'm moving from my PC I may want to keep watching the video while I'm doint po** or whatever, I've to manually search the video. 
- When I want to share a video on whatsapp, I don't like to have whatsapp open in my PC, so I've to search the video in mobile and share it.
